# ECMWF Jupyterbook learning resource template

This repository is a github template to facilitate development and maintenance of ECMWF Jupyterbooks used for learning.

A new repository can be created from this by simply selecting the green `Use this template` icon on the top right. Create a repository from this template for Jupyterbooks you plan to develop for training purposes at ECMWF.

The default branch for this repository is **develop**, and this branch is used to deploy the review/development version of the JupyterBook. The **main** branch is reserved for published content and will be maintained by ECMWF.

The repository includes github-actions which will automatically build a develop version of the Jupyter Book that can be used for review purposes.

## Notebook development instructions

When developing a notebook please follow the templating guide found in the 
[jupyter-notebook-template](https://github.com/ecmwf-training/jupyter-notebook-template).

The dependancies for the notebooks in this repository should be listed in the environment.yml file.
(Please note that the dependancies listed in `ci/requirements.txt` are for the github actions, you should not need to modify these dependancies)


## Jupyterbook Build instructions

Notebook providers are responsible for ensuring that the github actions succesfully build and deploy the
JupyterBook. It is advisable to test run the build commands and inspect the output locally before pushing
to the repository as this will save you time and effort.

### Building the JupyterBook locally

The following instructions are for Linux and MacOS users.

It is recommended that you test the build locally prior to creating your pull request to develop,
this will address many of the minor issues you may face and provide you with more readable output.
To ensure that you have the same software installed required to build the JupyterBook,
and that you are not using any unsupported software packages during a local build, it is recommended
that you create an conda-forge environment for building Jupyter Books:

```
conda create -y -n JUPYTER-BUILD -c conda-forge python=3.12
conda activate JUPYTER-BUILD
pip install jupyter-book
```

With your JUPYTER-BUILD environment activated the following line will build the jupyterbook locally:

```
rm -rf _build
jupyter-book build --all .
```

This will create all the html files used to create the JupyterBook in the untracked `_build/` folder.
You can open the homepage of this local build with:

```
open _build/html/index.html
```

### GitHub actions

There are two github actions in place for this repository:

The **`Build`** action builds the JupyterBook using the same proceedure as local build described below.
It is activated when a pull request to the `develop` branch is opened, or when any change is made to the 
develop branch (e.g. after merging a pull request). A pull request can only be merged
into the develop branch if the `Build` action is successful.

The **`Deploy`** action deploys the build JupyterBook to the github pages associated with this repository.
This action is activated when a change is made to the develop branch, after the build action.

The requirements of the github actions are listed in `ci/requirements.txt`, do not modify this file.
The dependancies of your notebooks should be stored in the `environment.yml` file.

## Troubleshooting notes

1. Multiple Level 1 Headers (#) in a notebook seems to break the _toc definition of title. It is also bad practice so discourage.
2. JupyterBooks do not have a running python kernel, threrefore they are not compatible with interactive widgets which require a running kernel, e.g. a number of ipywidgets, as documented here: https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/interactive/interactive.html?highlight=widgets#ipywidgets
3. Any additional images included in the notebook should be added using markdown hyperlink syntax, html syntax does not work with our jupyter-books. e.g.: `![](.images.png)`
4. Please avoid using placeholder hyperlinks using (the HTML <a> tag without a href provided) and within notebook cross-references (links between sections of the notebook). Due to platform differences they are not rendered correctly on JupyterBook pages and causes many compilation warnings and errors. This means it is much harder for us to identify real issues in the notebook, slowing down the integration process.
5. Please refrain from using HTML tags in general as they often intefere with the HTML config that JupyterBook builds and do not necessarily produce the intended effect when deployed in different environments. Markdown should offer all the text formatting required for the purposes of these traning notebooks.
